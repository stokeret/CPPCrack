# CPPCrack

Task 1 is a program designed to validate the theoretical Mini-ISBN or ISBN-6 Code.

Task 2 contains two seperate programs, one (BCHGen.cpp) is designed to generate 10 digit BCH codes from a 6 digit input and the other (BCHErrorCorrector.cpp) is designed to validate and correct two errors for BCH (10, 6) codes.

Set A, B and C are a collection of programs I had to write for an assignment in the third year of my cryptography module that use C++ to crack hashes based upon different character sets.

Task 4 is (unfinished as of yet) and will be a program to encrypt and decrypt as well as utilising steganogrphy from a given input.

All code is my own and I am choosing to open source it.
